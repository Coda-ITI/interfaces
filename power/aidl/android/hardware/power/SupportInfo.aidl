/**
 * Tells clients the status of various PowerHAL features in a single call.
 * SupportInfo consists of several bitsets, where each bit from the left
 * corresponds to the support status of that same value of that enum index.
 *
 * For "Boost", having the first bit set would mean "INTERACTION"
 * boost is supported, having the second bit set would mean
 * "DISPLAY_UPDATE_IMMINENT" is supported, and so on. The expectation
 * is that if a client should be able to index the bitset like
 * "(supportInfo.boosts >> Boost::AUDIO_LAUNCH) % 2" and it should return
 * the support value of Boost::AUDIO_LAUNCH. This pattern is the same for
 * all four support bitsets.
